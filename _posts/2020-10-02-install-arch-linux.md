# How to install Arch Linux- a quick and dirty guide

This is a guide for how to install Arch Linux. While [the wiki's install guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) is the best source, I've found a bit of ambiguity there.

This is what I personally do when I install Arch Linux.

(This assumes a QWERTY layout)

I'm going to do these steps on a BIOS (64bit) VM, howeverâ€” I've installed on a 64bit uEFI machine.

Download the Arch linux iso [here](https://archlinux.org/download)  (I'd recommend a torrent, they're faster.)

Once you've burned it and booted it, you should see the cli prompt:
![prompt](https://i.imgur.com/2QQEhLV.png)

After doing so, make sure you can:

- Connect to the internet
- Use the DNS

To do so:
```
ping 8.8.8.8 OR 1.1.1.1
ping archlinux.org OR {{any other website (amazon.com, google.com etc.)}}
```
(Press Ctrl-c to stop a running command)
After doing so if you see something like this:
![networking](https://i.imgur.com/j6YTzYX.png)

It means that you have internet connection.

You now need to sync the clocks:

`timedatectl set-ntp true`

If you see some systemd messages (`[ OK ] reached foo.target` or `[ OK ] started bar.service`) ignore those.

After doing so, we'll partition the disks.

If you are using **BIOS**, this is what I would recommend:

| Path | Size | Filesystem | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---------- | ----- |
| /dev/sda1 | Size of ram | Swap | Needs swap flag set (82) |
| /dev/sda2 | Rest of disk | Ext4 | Root partition | 



If you are using **uEFI**, I would use this:

| Path | Size | Filesystem | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---------- | ----- |
| /dev/sda1 | 512M | Fat32 | EFI system partition |
| /dev/sda2 | Size of ram | Swap |
| /dev/sda3 | Rest of disk | Ext4 | Root |

To create the partition, run:
```
cfdisk /dev/sda
```
For BIOS, select "DOS" label, otherwise, use "GPT"
This is what a BIOS scheme should look like:
(If it asks for `primary` or `logical`, select primary)

![BIOS](https://i.imgur.com/TiLdUCi.png)

(To set the partition type to swap select (TYPE) and then press up once to select "Linux Swap"

For uEFI, instead of a 512M and 4.5G, you should have a 512M with the "EFI system partition" type set, a swap partition with type "Linux Swap" and then the rest as a Linux filesystem.

To create the filesystems:

For your swap partition (/dev/sda1 on BIOS, /dev/sda2 on uEFI):
`mkswap /dev/sdaX`

For your EFI partition **uEFI only**:
`mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda1`

And then for your root (/dev/sda2 on BIOS, /dev/sda3 on uEFI):
`mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdaX` (This can take a while)

![Filesystems](https://i.imgur.com/b5fSBLC.png)

After doing so, enable your swap and mount your root partition at /mnt:

```
swapon /dev/sdaX
mount /dev/sdaX /mnt
```
So for my BIOS systems:
![mount](https://i.imgur.com/fgCIX7B.png)

# IF YOU HAVE uEFI, YOU *NEED* TO DO THIS:

Mount your efi parition at /mnt/boot:
```
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
```
Now you need to setup your mirrors.
This is not required but is ***highly*** recommended.
`reflector --verbose --latest 20 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`

This will print a couple of lines of text and then appear to hang, however, don't press Ctrl-c, it's processing.

![Mirrors](https://i.imgur.com/DvclPV2.png)

After it completes, we need to install our base system.

We can run `pacstrap` to do so.

You can add packages, but I'd just stick to the given command unless you know what you're doing.

`pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware grub networkmanager git nano`

Once you run this, it'll take a while, go and find a soda.

![pacstrap](https://i.imgur.com/OYaaqoT.png)

After we do this, we need to generate our fstab (eff-stab, fs-tab, fs-table).

This tells Linux what filesystems need to be mounted, and where.

`genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab`

After this, we are now ready to "chroot" in (use the installed system) and do some configuration!

Let's pivot to the new install:
`arch-chroot /mnt`

![chroot](https://i.imgur.com/Gg6ZCdY.png)

We now need to set the timezone.

You'll run `ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/{{Region}}/{{Zone}}`
(If you need a hint, press tab)

Then, sync your hardware clock:
`hwclock --systohc`

After that, we need to generate our locales.

Edit /etc/locale.gen:
`nano /etc/locale.gen`

and find your zone.

For me, it's `en_US.UTF-8` and uncomment it (remove the #)

Then press Ctrl-x and then y & enter to save and quit.

![locale.gen](https://i.imgur.com/jdVGrOz.png)

We now need to run `locale-gen`.

After this, let's set our hostname.

edit `/etc/hostname` to set it (It can only contain a-z and hypens)
I'm going to use `arch` as my hostname.
![hostname](https://i.imgur.com/KD1fHYd.png)

Again, save and quit.

We now need to setup our `/etc/hosts` file.

You need to add these lines:
```
127.0.0.1<tab>localhost
::1<tab><tab>localhost
127.0.1.1<tab>{hostname}.localdomain<tab>{hostname}
```

If your computer has a permanent IP address, use it instead of `127.0.1.1`
![hosts](https://i.imgur.com/VHX47c4.png)

Save and quit.

You now need to set your root password with `passwd`.
I'm going to use `foo` as mine.

After you do that, we need to install our bootloader.

## BIOS

If you have a BIOS system, install for a x86 arch:
`grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda`

## uEFI
If you have a uEFI system, make sure your EFI partition is mounted at /boot and then run this:
`grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=Arch`

After this, regenerate the config:
`grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`

![bootloader](https://i.imgur.com/Qjh0qbm.png)

Now exit the chroot (`exit`)

We now can reboot and hope that it works. (`reboot`)

Once you see your login, login with `root` and then the password you set.

# Success!
![success](https://i.imgur.com/QIgOJku.png)

After you login, we need to enable networking:
`systemctl enable --now NetworkManager`
After that, ping `archlinux.org` to make sure it's working.
![network](https://i.imgur.com/X8wFN3S.png)

As you can see I had a little type in the service name, but now it's working!

Now let's install X.org:
`pacman -S xorg --noconfirm`

After that, you need to decide on a gui.

| GUI | package name |
| --- | ------------ |
| Kde | plasma |
| GNOME | gnome |
| LXDE | ldxe | 


After installing Xorg, install the name of the package for your GUi.
Here I'll use LXDE:
`pacman -S ldxe --noconfirm`
After doing so, enable your Display manager:
| GUI | Manager|
| ---| --- |
| KDE | sddm |
| GNOME | gdm |
| LXDE | lxdm |


So for LXDE, run `systemctl enable lxdm`
![display manger](https://i.imgur.com/jyNhxM5.png)

Create a symlink to vi: `ln -sf $(which nano) /usr/bin/vi`.

Now run `sudo visudo` and find the line that starts with %sudo and uncomment it.

![visudo](https://i.imgur.com/yznl85H.png)

After that, remove the symlink: `rm /usr/bin/vi`
Save and quit, then create the sudo group and add your user:
```
groupadd sudo
useradd -m -G sudo {username}
```
Then set your user's password:
`passwd {user}`

You should then install a terminal (I'd recommend Kitty) and reboot.

After that, your display manager should ask for username and password.

As you can see, mine went fine.

![fine](https://i.imgur.com/4zOKtub.png)

Just one more thing now: enable AUR support.

To do this, open a terminal and run:
```
sudo pacman -S git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
```
To install YaY.

After that, you're all good.

Just install Neofetch and brag to your friends!
