# How to make a good user interface

While browsing repl talk #share, I found a lot of bad interfaces. Not mentioning names, but I want to correct this:

# Program output:

## KISS 
Don't add all the frills unless required.
This means:
- No TTYesque output. (
    ```python
    for c in str:
        print(c, end='')
        sleep(0.05)
    ```
)
- No rainbow text
- No pauses for interpolation

## Be like `clang`

Clang, a C compiler, has some very good error messages:
```
t.c:1:1: warning: return type of 'main' is not 'int' [-Wmain-return-type]
void main()
^
t.c:1:1: note: change return type to 'int'
void main()
^~~~
```

It tells you what you did wrong, and how to fix it.

Some messages are bad:

# Program input

## Follow common practice

If you're making a shell/OSlike thing, don't:

- Present the user with a menu
- Make programs called `ReadFileContents` when `cat` works/
- Get in the user's way. (Windows XP won't let you read the root of C:)

You should:
- Have a help menu
- According to *The zen of python* :
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

## Make it fast.
If it takes 30 seconds to install packages, the user will be mad when they look at your project.

Don't use Colorama when `\033[0m` will work

If you need to install 30 packages:
# You are doing it wrong

Don't do fake loading.

If your program needs to read a long file, say so.

Don't do:
```python
import halo, time
with halo.Halo(message="Loading OS"):
  time.sleep(2000000000)
```
# UX

## The user is dumb.

Design your app as if a five year old or Gilligan had to use it.

Assume they will enter invalid input
Assume they don't RTMP (Read the man pages)
Assume they use a command wrong

## Respond to user feedback
If someone says 'I don't like the color of your giant ascii logo', **fix it** .
If people say your `slow_print` function is too slow, **fix it**.



# Documentation is like salmon: when it is good, it is very, very good; and when it is bad, it is better than nothing

Document the *NIX out of your code. If you write a good post on how to use it, people will be more liberal with their upvotes.

If it's not good, it's better than none.    

`$ logout`
